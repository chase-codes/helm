### BUG-001 — Stale focus ring persists on mouse-clicked controls after keyboard navigation
**Status:** Open · **Area:** Songs → section rail + transport (`SectionRail.tsx`, `SongsMode.tsx`); likely app-wide

**Repro (two confirmed triggers):**
- _Section rail:_
  1. In Songs, open a song so its sections show in the rail.
  2. **Click a section with the mouse** to select it, and go live (or already be live).
  3. Use the **arrow keys** to navigate to a different section.
- _Transport button:_
  1. **Click "Cue next ›" (or "‹ Prev") with the mouse** (`SongsMode.tsx:426,429`).
  2. Continue navigating with the **arrow keys**.

**Expected:** Only the current cued/live section carries a highlight; nothing else retains
a ring once navigation (keyboard) moves on.

**Actual:** Whatever was **last clicked with the mouse** keeps a persistent, faded
("degraded") ring — the originally selected section row, and separately the Cue-next
transport button.

**Suspected cause (unverified):** A lingering DOM focus outline. A mouse click focuses the
clicked `<button>` (section rows `SectionRail.tsx:76`; transport `SongsMode.tsx:426,429`).
Arrow-key navigation is handled at the mode level and updates app state **without moving or
clearing DOM focus**, so the last-clicked element keeps a browser focus ring. That it
reproduces on both a section row **and** an unrelated transport button — and only after a
**mouse** click (keyboard-only nav never focuses these) — points to a general focus-outline
issue, not per-component state. If confirmed, the fix is likely global (e.g. a
`:focus-visible`-only outline policy, or blur-on-click) rather than one-off per control.
Rule out a diverging cued/live index during verification.

**Notes:** Only observed after a mouse click; keyboard-only navigation doesn't leave a ring.
Two distinct controls affected (section row + transport), suggesting broad scope.
